This repository should hold source code for third party tools that have been verified/validated for use.

Where possible the source code should be taken from official images and stored here.

Files should be named in a way to ensure the resulting docker images can be traced back to this dockerfile, eg by saving the Image ID in the name of the dockerfile.
